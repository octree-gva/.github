# Decidim & civic techs

<br /><img src="https://github.com/octree-gva/meta/blob/main/decidim/static/participerge/mobile_participer_ge.png?raw=true" /><br />

Decidim is an open-source platform that can easily be tailored to suit the needs of your project: whether it’s about public concertations, digital democracy, or distributed governance, it’s a plug & play solution. Among other benefits, Decidim enables to strengthen your citizen’s trust in participatory processes by grounding itself in a core of transparent and open-source values, enabling a boost in engagement.

Unlike a fair number of civic tech proprietary solutions available today on the market, Decidim is licensed under open-source standards, which means it is not only safer than most solutions but simply also naturally transparent concerning the use of data. Decidim is supported by the European Union and benefits of years of improvements contributed by an international community of cities and regions which have been now using it for years, like Barcelona, Helsinki, or Mexico.

Decidim is made of powerful but intuitive modules, enabling administrators to create, manage, and moderate activities such as concertations, meetings, debates, participatory budgeting, and even a voting module. These solutions are accompanied by usage statistics, user accounts, and community management tools.

As a <a href="https://octree.ch/en/startup-as-a-service/">Lean startup studio</a>, Octree is specialized in digital transformation and pragmatic innovation strategy. These two approaches are naturally mobilized to serve our ecological values.<br />
Smart cities must articulate effective change in the areas of **consumption**, **building energy management**, **circular economy**, **mobility**, and **waste management** to name a few.

<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octree-gva/.github/README/img/lean.png"  alt="Quickly test your application, avoid developing features that will never be used" /><br />

Our approach fuses Lean & Agile methods
We move forward the development of your web application, taking into account all your hypotheses. We help you to define a <a href="https://octree.ch/en/go-to-market-fast/">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</a> before starting the development. 

This method avoids developing features that will never be used and enables you to quickly test your web application with your users.

We know how to deal with the unexpected, thanks to our Agile development methods. You regularly receive deliverables and you can redefine your development priorities at any time while staying in control of your budget.
